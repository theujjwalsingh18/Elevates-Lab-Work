# 🚀 Elevates Lab Work

> **Internship Project Repository**  
> This repository contains all the lab tasks completed during my internship with **Elevates**. Each task focuses on a core concept of Machine Learning and Data Science, implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## 📌 Overview

The objective of this repository is to showcase my understanding and implementation of key machine learning algorithms and techniques as part of the internship assignment.

- ✅ 8 Completed Tasks
- 📊 Implemented with real-world datasets
- 🧪 Visualizations, Model Training, and Evaluation
- 📂 Individual folders per task with separate `README.md` and notebooks

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

Throughout these tasks, I gained hands-on experience in:
- End-to-end ML workflow
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- Model selection and evaluation
- Data storytelling with EDA
- Using Python libraries for ML & visualization
